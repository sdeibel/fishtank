Fishtank
========

This is a simple fish "game" that I'm going to use as a motivator for learning
different programming concepts in Python.

The idea is to start with a reasonably structured program and point them to
the parts they can work on, and then teach them concepts in that context. I
was motivated to write this example by the fact that many pygame examples are
just a huge messy loop, or are much more complex than this game. I would
rather show students a reasonably structured program from the start so they
can learn by example how functions, objects, etc are used to keep code simple
and understandible.

Students can add their own type of fish with its own movement pattern, extend
existing fish (for example, to add an "eating" mode), add algae growth and
extend the sucker fish to remove algae, add interactions between the fish.
Once they have a command of the basic concepts they can undertake other tasks
of their own design.
